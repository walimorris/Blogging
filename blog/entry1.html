    <p>September 7, 2020</p>

        <b>Remember those days of MySpace, AOL and Nokia phones.</b> Well, around this time is when my Dad pulled into the drive-way with a car loaded with Dell PCs. I didn't even ask, but I received my first personal computer, and I could do essentially
        anything I wanted. I decided to deck out my MySpace account with 50cent and Greenday playlists. I was probably into Usher and Blink 182 as well, so yeah these were the days when having broad musical taste was smiled upon. Anyways, I stayed up
        long nights just messing around on AOL Instant Messenger(AIM) and my favorite website, ugotgames.com(if you want to check it out, it's still out there in the wild). In school, I decided to take a fancy computer lab that taught things like PowerPoint,
        Excel, Word and all the other business software programs. I thought I'd be doing other things like learning how to program, that's not what this was at all. So, a few friends and I learned some basic html and did silly things like change the words
        on a page. A few times, I saw Java and stored it somewhere in the back of my mind. In those days, I was involved in sports, playing the saxophone, and being an all around amazing millenial consumer. Since I can remember, I knew my journey would
        begin in the military in some capacity. So, my journey with programming and software development doesn't begin in my wee teenage years, sorry to disappoint I know those stories are always a blast. Instead, after 8 years in the military I had my
        first significant experience.

        <b>Fast forward after my military career.</b> I was taking general college courses and I was interested in business and technology. I ended up enrolling into a Intro to Linux course. Before this course, my consumer skills were sky-high and I thought
        I knew my way around a computer. How I was wrong. Linux really opened my eyes to a lot of things to include: opensource software, collaboartion in software development, viewing computer files in a more detailed manner, administation, and a small
        bit of security, which will be in another blog. I was really turned on by the idea of opensource software, I mean who wouldn't want to work on their favorite apps? This can be a very long and complex discussion so I'll stop there and get back
        on topic.
